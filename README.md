# Spellcheck

Create as a Directive which allows the selector `[cahSpellcheck]` to be added to a component as an attribute.

```html
<input class="test" cahSpellcheck>
```

## 

Connect into the right click event (`onContextMenuItemClick`).

The browser by default:

* Will highlight what it things are misspelled words (red wiggly underline).
* Will select the word that is right-clicked on.
